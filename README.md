## FAQ

### I'm using Chrome and I get a PermissionDeniedError

Chrome 47 and higher block non-TLS access to WebRTC. Try accessing Tuber with HTTPS. If you would like to help us develop Tuber, please consider writing [tools that assist with the creation and installation of TLS certificates](https://github.com/trailofbits/tubertc/issues/54) for local installations.

### Some users can't send or receive audio/video

Tuber has trouble talking with users behind NAT. Supporting users behind NAT requires a [properly configured and tested STUN/TURN server](https://github.com/trailofbits/tubertc/issues/8). As it stands, Tuber works fine on most corporate LANs but, due to this issue, has trouble working reliably on the open internet.
